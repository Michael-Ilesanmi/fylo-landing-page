# fylo-landing-page
This landing page is a Level 2 major task for my SideHustle.ng internship. 
The challenge is from Frontendmentor(dot)io.
Using the design format recommended by Frontendmentor, I have made a responsive design for both small screens (mobile phones & tablets) and large screens (pc).
You could go through the code and reuse if you need to.
I would also really appreciate feedbacks, if you don't mind. Thank you.
